## 🌟 The Vision
By 2026, we aim to reduce household food waste by 25%. FreshTrack AI uses **Computer Vision** to see what you see, identifying rot before it happens and reading labels so you don't have to.

### 🚀 Core Features
* **AI Freshness Scanner:** Real-time visual analysis of produce (Apples, Bananas, Spinach, etc.).
* **OCR Expiry Detection:** Automatically extracts "Best Before" dates from packaged items.
* **Virtual Inventory:** A synchronized list of your fridge contents.
* **Smart Reminders:** Push notifications sent 24 hours before an item is predicted to spoil.
